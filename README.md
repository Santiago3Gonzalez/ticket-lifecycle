<p>
Signing in as users and creating a ticket using the help topics I created in my previous project
</p>
<br />

<p>

<p>
Hitting open a new ticket and signing in as another user and creating another ticket
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Selecting the first ticket I made and then updating the priority, department, assigning to Jane (currently signe in as Jane), and changing SLAs. Highlighted in blue you can see the thread of changes as well
</p>
<br />


<p>

</p>
<p>
This is how it looks to change the priority
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Now I let the user know that we are actively working on their ticket and what's the plan
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Now osTicket shows the ticket as updated and at the top of all other tickets
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Now I go back in to let them know that a solution was found and make sure to mark the ticket as resolved
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
In the tickets tab, I travel to closed to tickets to see if it is closed
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
I go into the second ticket and update priority, SLA and assign it to John (agent). And then in blue you can see that I communicate what was done
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
For the third ticket, I change priority, SLA, and assign it to Jane. Then I solve the ticket as it is a question that can be answered fast. Marked it as resolved
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bEPjYnY.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
I log out of osTicket as Jane and log back in as John to complete the ticket Jane had assigned me
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FhVxkPm.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Resolved the final ticket as John
